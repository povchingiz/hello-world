new driver was found, it is my reputation.
I might give a fuck about what other people think about me and think like "there is no tomorrow", "after a 5 year period everything will be forgotten".
which is true, BUT the society still remains the way it is.
so reputation credits are there. My blogs and CV would remember everything. I might dislike some of my relatives, but still I have a world to be handed over to my children.
if i would live a chaotic life, their lives would get complicated. I do not want this at all, I want to be the best father possible accounting to my abilities.

This year is getting more and more aligned with my plans from January,
- I graduate from university as Bachelor of science in mathematics,  
- I get an excellent job offer from NITEC JLC as a machine learning engineer, earning 600 000 kzt after taxes, 
- create my own educational company growing into edu-AI-startup
- got married 
- updated my wardrobe
- training every day
