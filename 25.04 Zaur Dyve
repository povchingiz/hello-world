Zaur is about to get married

I understood that almost any intellectual problem can be solved by chatgpt
It can help me with generating course plans, homeworks, checking them, creating bots to lead students
It can even help me with creating instructions on how to enter our ecosystem

investigating new ai systems, models in math and career horizons.
I need a clear system that would guide all my thoughts. because for now github, notes in telegram and irl copybook are very disconnected from each other
