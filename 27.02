Met with Wei closer, hopefully gon make some research and contribute to our academic achievements.

he's good + Alibi they know how to move from my position. Need to listen them closely.
as well as find research work opportunities.

is it like collecting "data" on stock prices for example, plug them in a formula, lets say black scholes merton,
can I then evaluate variables with statistical methods? find "true" value with some confidence interval.
why can't we estimate any formula? any data?

bsm is option oriented, why we covered it so much then? 

numerical, statistics are FUNDAMENTAL for my future
