average day - starts silly, with big big goals closer to the end, when the lights out.

i don't know why, it was the case in the school. Im just better when the lights are out)

initiated course request, this spring is having me talking a lot to strangers. not difficult, just think that there is no other
option and life depends on it.

somehow felt something unpleasant about Leila's dr and balloons. fuck it, relieve)
no one owes nothing to me and i owe nothing to them, these are my limitations in mind. they prefer themselves
i prefer people
don't know if its good or baad.

this is again my ego/nafs/uyat
