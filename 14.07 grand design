I have a plan for the whole life, which is coming down to "NOW" 
I am not needed to follow nihilistic path (?)
I am what I am, it makes me what I am
I don't need to spend all of the money/ time on pleasure. its short term cheap dopamine. it would destroy the life quicker

I am scared of many things and that's probably why I choose to go slowly. It's okay
it's okay to feel not okay, but it does not mean you should hide away.
you can feel anything, but don't act destructively.

always a positive sum game.no matter what. tired? go relax.

life plan -> 5 years -> 1 year -> 12 weeks -> NOW

i am happy for this 1.5 months of work with ISSAI and NITEC. Learn't many cool things, that are traceable to the future
