everyday is a fight, i was loosing, because i always self sabotage myself about worst scenarios and shit.
does it help? not really
im just sitting waiting for it to happen, with all the analysis paralysis, and self-created prophecy.

this is totally uncool and can  not continue this way. I thought that the whole world is against me
that everybody hates me in a certain way or disrespects me, but in reality
nobody gives a single fuck about me whether I am here or not. my succession is only my thing
nobody is here to help, nobody is here to rely on. there was my family, when i was a child

but not now. parents would give me the world, they tried to
gave me the best education, shown me the world, the people, the judgement of good and bad
and then my father started his infinite journey and my mother is still recovering. its gon be 7 years. 7 years.
and im still "figuring it out"
when the real thing is work, passionate and endless grind towards my better self. I stated so many times that my past self can not sustain me and my goals any longer
and i  thought like okay, "the update is coming out tonight, don't turn off the device" thing would happen
but it would never. nothing is here for free. everything, literally everything is labour. everything is grind. everything is about to shapen + sharpen the way i live, so it is 
about me, not giving a shit. 

из прошлого себя, из говна и палок соорудить себя нового. новые привычки, заменить старые, заменить взгляды, мышление. Старое оно привычнее и оно само происходит, на автопилоте
когда сознание отключается и хочет отдохнуть.
откровения Рамадана.
